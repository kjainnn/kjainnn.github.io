					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the duration of an animation should be slow enough to give the user time to notice the change, but quick enough to ensure the user is not kept waiting. Between 200 and 500 ms is the optimal speed for animations, accoridng to several researches. The duration should be shorter on mobile devices and longer on tablets.   </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was looking at the visuals which demonstrated good and bad examples for what was being discussed. This was my favorite part because it made it easier to  understand what was being discussed. I especially liked the example that also had the car in it.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "But do not forget that animation is more of an art than science, so itâ€™s better to experiment and test your decisions on users." </p>
						</li>
