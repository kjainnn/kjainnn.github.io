				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that dark patterns don't have the interest of the user in mind. I also learned that dark patters are not limited to the web. I also learned that some of the types of dark patterns on Brignull's website include: Bait and Switch, Disguised Ads, and Forced Continuity. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article was reading about the different types of dark patterns. By reading through each one in detail, I learned a lot. I also liked that there was a section for possible solutions to dark patterns.   </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "When you use the web, you don't read every wrod on every page - you skin read and make assumptions. If a company wants to trick you into doing something, they can take advantage of it by making a page look like it is saying one thing when in fact it is saying another. You can defend yourself against dark patterns on this site." - Harry Brignull, 2010 </p>
