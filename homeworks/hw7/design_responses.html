							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article were the pictures of the clouds that resemebled what looked like a horse and what looked like a heart. I thought it was interesting that the article explained how our brain "connects the dots" when perceiving different shapes. I really liked that it mentioned that understanding the brain can make one a wiser designer.  </p>
