					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> <img src = "assets/imgs/originalWireframeGoogle.jpg" /> Google </p>
							
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> <img src = "assets/imgs/wireframeGoogleRedesigned.jpg" /> Google </p>
							
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of this website (Google) is to make information accessible to everyone. This is intended for anyone that wants to get more information about a particular topic. The design helps accomplish this by creating a very simple page with the search bar in the middle, which helps guide one's focus directly to it.    </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> My redesign addressed problems with the search bar features. I replaced the boxes below the search bar with "For You" and "Popular Searches," which I feel are more useful to a user, especially since "For You" would provide a personalized search experience by providing reccomendations of searches that Google thinks you may want to search for. I included the word "Search" inside the search bar to make it intuitive for the user to search there, moved the magnifying glass to the right side of the search bar in a shaded box to provide a concise and easy way for the user to click on it if they wish to search that way (instead of having a bigger "Google Search" button at the bottom of the search bar like the original design), and included the microphone and image box outside the search bar for alternative ways to search.   </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
