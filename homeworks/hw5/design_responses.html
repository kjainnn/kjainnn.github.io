                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned how different animations and visuals can enhance the product offering. It was really cool to focus on this aspect, since in real life I would just use the app and glance over these cool UI's. I now understand how important good UI is to a product offering. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was how visual it was. In each visual, I learned something new. I think the very first one was especially impressive with their visuals.  </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite was the first one - the Welcome screen / login page by Andrej Radisic. I thought the visuals and transitions were super interesting to look at it. I think the transition was especially cool, as it made me stop and think for a couple seconds before realizing I was on a screen where I would have to enter my username and password. </p>
