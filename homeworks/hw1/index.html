        <p>Hi! My name is Kabir and I like to dance and travel. I also love to spend time with family and friends, go to the gym, and watch shows on Netflix. I'm grateful that I have the opportunity to attend UC Berkeley.   </p>

            <li> I learned the importance of actually analyzing an app,  instead of just using the app and just scrolling through content. Hierachy, content, intent, and audience are some of the things that I now know to keep in mind.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part of this article was looking at the GIFs that deconstructed apps so I could look at each component. I thought the Spotify example was really interesting because I really like using that app. </li>
            <li> "By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself." </li>
